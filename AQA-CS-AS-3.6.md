# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.6 3.6	Fundamentals of computer systems 

### 3.6.1 	Hardware  and software
#### 3.6.1.1 Relationship  between hardware and software
+ Understand the relationship between hardware and software and be able to define the terms:
    + hardware
	+ software

#### 3.6.1.2 Classification of software
+ Explain what is meant by:
	+ system software
	+ application software.
+ Understand the need for, and attributes of, different types of software.

#### 3.6.1.3 System software
+ Understand the need for, and functions of the following system software:
	+ operating systems (OSs)
	+ utility programs
	+ libraries
	+ translators (compiler, assembler, interpreter).

#### 3.6.1.4 Role of an operating system (OS)
+ Understand that the role of the operating system is to create a virtual machine. This means that the complexities of the hardware are hidden from the user.

+ Know that the OS handles resource management, managing hardware to allocate processors, memories and I/O devices among competing processes.

### 3.6.2 	Classification of programming languages
+ Show awareness of the development of types of programming languages and their classification into low-and high-level languages.
+ Know that low-level languages are considered to be:
	+ machine-code
	+ assembly language.

+ Know that high-level languages include imperative high level-language.
+ Describe machine-code language and assembly language.
+ Understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine-code and assembly language programming compared with high-level language programming.
+ Explain the term ‘imperative high-level language’ and its relationship to low-level languages.

### 3.6.3 Types of program  translator
#### 3.6.3.1 Types of program translator
+ Understand the role of each of the following:
	+ assembler
	+ compiler
	+ interpreter.

+ Explain the differences between compilation and interpretation. Describe situations in which each would be appropriate.

+ Explain why an intermediate language such as bytecode is produced as the final output by some compilers and how it is subsequently used.

+ Understand the difference between source and object (executable) code.
