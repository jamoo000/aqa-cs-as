## 3.7  Fundamentals of computer organisation and architecture

# Internal hardware components of a computer

**Objectives**: Have an understanding and knowledge of the basic internal components of a computer system.


### Processor, ALU, Control Unit,Registers, Memory
**Objectives**: understand the role of the following components and how they relate to each other:

+ Processor

+ The control unit

+ Registers

+ ALU

+ Memory



### Buses - data bus, control bus and address bus
*Objectives*: Understand the need for, and means of, communication between components. In particular, understand the concept of a bus and how address, data and control buses are used.

+ Address bus


+ Data bus


+ Control bus


+ I/O controllers



### The von Neumann and Harward architectures

*Objectives*: Be able to explain the difference between von Neumann and Harvard architectures and describe where each is typically used.


### Understand the concept of addressable memory.


# The stored  program  concept


# Structure and role of the processor  and its components

## The processor and its components

### Explain the role and operation of a processor and its major components:


## The Fetch-Execute cycle and the role of registers within it 

### Explain how the Fetch-Execute cycle is used to execute machine code programs, including the stages in the cycle (fetch, decode, execute) and details of registers used.
## The processor instruction set
### Understand the term ‘processor instruction set’ and know that an instruction set is processor specific.
### Know that instructions consist of an opcode and one or more operands (value, memory address or register).

## Addressing modes

### Understand and apply immediate and direct addressing modes.
## Machine-code/assembly language operations

#### Understand and apply the basic machine-code operations of:
  + load
  + add
  + subtract
  + store
  + branching (conditional and unconditional)
  + compare
  + logical bitwise operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
  + logical
  + shift right
  + shift left
  + halt.

Use the basic machine-code operations above when machine-code instructions are expressed in mnemonic form- assembly language, using immediate and direct addressing.
## Factors affecting  processor performance

### Explain the effect on processor performance of:
  +  multiple cores
  +  cache memory
  +  clock speed
  +  word length
  +  address bus width
  +  data bus width.

# External hardware devices

## Input and output devices


#### Know the main characteristics, purposes and suitability of the devices and understand their principles of operation.
  + barcode reader
  + digital camera
  + laser printer
  + RFID

## Secondary  storage devices

### Explain the need for secondary storage within a computer system.

### Know the main characteristics, purposes, suitability and understand the principles of operation of the following devices:

  + hard disk
  + optical disk
  + solid-state disk (SSD)

    SSD = NAND flash memory + a controller that manages pages, and blocks and complexities of writing. Based on floating gate transistors that trap and store charge. A block, made up of many pages, cannot overwrite pages, page has to be erased before it can be written to but technology requires the whole block to be erased. Lower latency and faster transfer speeds than a magnetic disk drive.
### Compare the capacity and speed of access of various media and make a judgement about their suitability for different applications.
