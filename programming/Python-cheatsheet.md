## Python variables
1. a name for computer's location where a value is stored
2. variable names cannot contain spaces, must not start with a number, must not contain symbols like !, @, #, $, %, and are case-sensitive
3. the value stored in a variable can be changed programmatically, i.e. myVar = 5, later, if we times the value by 5, myVar = myVar * 5, myVar is changed to 25

```python
myVar = 5
myVar = myVar * 5
print (myVar)
```
