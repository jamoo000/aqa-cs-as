### 3.6.1 	Individual (moral), social (ethical), legal and cultural issues and opportunities

+ Show awareness of current individual (moral), social (ethical), legal and cultural opportunities and risks of computing.
+ Understand that:
	+ developments in computer science and the digital technologies have dramatically altered the shape of communications and information  ows in societies, enabling massive transformations in the capacity to:
	+ monitor behaviour
	+ amass and analyse personal information
	+ distribute, publish, communicate and disseminate personal information
	+ computer scientists and software engineers therefore have power, as well as the responsibilities that go with it, in the algorithms that they devise and the code that they deploy
	+ software and their algorithms embed moral and cultural values
	+ the issue of scale, for software the whole world over, creates potential for individual computer scientists and software engineers to produce great good, but with it comes the ability to cause great harm.
+ Be able to discuss the challenges facing legislators in the digital age.
